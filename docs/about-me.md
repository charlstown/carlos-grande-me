# About me

Welcome to my blog! I'm Carlos Grande a Data Engineer, Architect, and Coding enthusiast. In this site, you'll find projects, articles, and resources about data, coding, business, and AI. I hope you enjoy my content and find it useful.

The main reason I started to write this blog was to collect small pieces of knowledge and some of my favorite projects as a life cheat sheet or a personal guide. I wanted to follow an open-data practice inviting everyone to use my resources and improve my projects and ideas.
